intensity
	radius - 1x 2x 3x
	add square grid
	increase radius
	create nicer text in the boxes - especially make bottom row less confusing


kepler 2
	draw orbit track by storing data to array instead of using my function

kepler 3 grapher
	axis break lines
	make the graph wider
	move table beneath the graph
	units need to be squared / cubed


Priority---------------

set one window size scheme
	- scaling vs fixed
	** we actually can control window size in some circumstances, and sorta prevent user window resizing
	** we can set minimum areas so that the window will gain scroll bars instead of distort under a certain size
	

-----------------------

1) finish keppler law apps
2) finish photometry and intensity

-----------------------

kepler3
	look up rotation matrices

	

kepler2
	m1 - mass of the sun - kg
	g - gravity
	r - meters


	-G*m1/r + 1/2*v^2 = 0 <-- solve other app to verify the constant is zero

	.5*v^2 = G*m1/r

	v^2 = 2*(G*m1/r)

	v = sqrt(2*(g*m1/r))


	gives: m/s


photometry
	title
	label blue thing as light detector
	instructions on the bottom
	remove star animation - wait for decision of color
	text size issues


intensity
	remove bg image - more diagram like
	show original radius "R" arrows

cephied
	cosmetics
	missing sectors
	back button so wrong guesses don't have to go through the main grid page


retrograde
	additional bar on top or bottom
	fix the red dot bug in motion trail
	change venus speed to accentuate retrograde motion seen in from earth
	bigger stars so they show up in all browsers


helio / geo centric retrograde
	verify functionality of top bar
	possiblity of second dot / bar


black hole
	R instead of M for distance
	make sure three different perspectives are available as well as distance
