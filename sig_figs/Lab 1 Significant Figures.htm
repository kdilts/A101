<div id="main_column"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You probably learned about sig figs in high school chemistry because that is where you really began to <strong>quantify</strong> your experiments. If you haven't learned sig figs before don't worry, they are just a fancy name for something that you already know. If you have seen the topic before then this short refresher will not bother you at all - astronomers blow things up a lot less frequently than chemists!<br /><br /> <strong class="style3">Accuracy and Precision</strong><br /><br /> Significant figures are all about precision. When a scientist, or anyone, states a value or quantity, the way that they state it tells you something about how accurately and precisely they know what they are talking about. For instance, on the right are two clocks that state the time at which you arrived at this page of the lab.</span> <br /><br />
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If you asked someone the time and they told you, "<canvas id='min' width="90" height="50" style="border:1px solid"></canvas>". Which clock must they have read? Clearly, they must be reading the digital clock because it has precision down to seconds. Both clocks are accurate in that they tell us the correct time. The clock with the most digits is the most precise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">They could have been less precise and said, "<canvas id='sec2' width="140" height="50" style="border:1px solid"></canvas>," but the fact that they stated more figures that had significance communicates to you that they must have something more precise than a face clock.<br /><br /> This concept will affect your work as you learn scientific perspective this semester. Let's look at a simple problem.</span></p>
<div class="problem">
<h3>Problem</h3>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Homer is 6.1 ft tall. Maggie is 1.7 ft tall. How many times larger than Maggie is Homer?</span></div>
<div class="problem">
<h3>Solution</h3>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">We must divide 6.1 ft by 1.7 ft. When I punch that into my calculator I get 3.588235294118.<br /><br /> So I should just write down and circle what my calculator says is the answer, right? No, because there are a lot of sig figs on the calculator screen that misrepresent our precision. We only know the two heights to an precision of two significant figures.  Therefore, we can only know how many times taller Homer is to the same degree of precision.  The correct answer would be 3.6 because it correctly expresses our precision. We could tell the difference between 3.5 and 3.7 by measuring - that's how we know 3.6 is right. It has as many sig figs (two) as the 6.1 ft and 1.7 ft that we were given originally.<br /><br /> But, by writing down exactly what is on your calculator screen you would be telling me that you could measure their heights to a trillionth of a foot and I would mark you <strong>wrong</strong>.</span><br /><br />  </div>
<h3>The Moral of the Story</h3>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">As you are going through this course think about the numbers that we tell you as well as the numbers that you hand in as answers. Scientists must pay attention to both the accuracy and precision of the ideas that they represent.</span></div>
