Priority---------------

set one window size scheme
	- scaling vs fixed
	** we actually can control window size in some circumstances, and sorta prevent user window resizing
	** we can set minimum areas so that the window will gain scroll bars instead of distort under a certain size
	

-----------------------

1) finish keppler law apps
2) finish photometry and intensity

-----------------------

*** make pop ups for clock and sci not

kepler 3

	look at modified euler method
	semi-implicit euler method <-- wikipedia


kepler 2
	m1 - mass of the sun - kg
	g - gravity
	r - meters


	-G*m1/r + 1/2*v^2 = 0 <-- solve other app to verify the constant is zero

	.5*v^2 = G*m1/r

	v^2 = 2*(G*m1/r)

	v = sqrt(2*(g*m1/r))


	gives: m/s


photometry
	label blue thing as light detector
	separate instructions

intensity
	change radius to area a, 4a, 9a...
	add slider to allow user to change distance
	bar graph that shows area, intensity, and area * intensity


cephied
	cosmetics
	missing sectors
	back button so wrong guesses don't have to go through the main grid page


retrograde
	additional bar on top or bottom
	fix the red dot bug in motion trail
	change venus speed to accentuate retrograde motion seen in from earth
	bigger stars so they show up in all browsers


helio / geo centric retrograde
	verify functionality of top bar
	possiblity of second dot / bar


black hole
	R instead of M for distance
	make sure three different perspectives are available as well as distance
