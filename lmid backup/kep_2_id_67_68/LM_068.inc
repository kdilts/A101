<div>The line joining the Sun and planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times, so the planet moves faster when it is nearer the Sun. Thus, a planet executes elliptical motion with constantly changing angular speed as it moves about its orbit. The point of nearest approach of the planet to the Sun is termed perihelion; the point of greatest separation is termed aphelion. Hence, by Kepler's second law, the planet moves fastest when it is near perihelion and slowest when it is near aphelion.</div>

<div style="text-align: left;"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.walter-fendt.de/ph14e/keplerlaw2.htm" class="applet">This applet</a> <font size="2"><font face="Arial" color="#ffffff">allows you to view the orbits of the 8 planets, Pluto, and Halley's comet around the sun and through two equal areas at perihelion (the closest point of the orbit to the Sun) and aphelion (the farthest point of the orbit from the Sun) to demonstrate Kepler's 2nd Law of Planetary Motion.  However, since the planets' orbits are nearly circular (not very elliptical), try looking at Pluto or Halley's comet to see the effects of Kepler's 2nd law on more elliptical orbits.  Compare how it moves when it is close to the Sun and when it is far away.  Try to express what you see in a sentence.</font></font></div>
